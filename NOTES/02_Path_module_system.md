### Path Module

The `path` module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.

- `path.dirname` → Returns the directory name of the given file path.
- `path.basename` → Returns the name of the given file (with extension).
- `path.extname` → Returns the extension of the given file.
- `path.join` → Joins multiple path segments into a single path using the correct separator.
- `path.resolve` → Resolves the given path segments into a single absolute path.
- `path.normalize` → Normalizes a path by resolving `..`, `.`, and removing redundant separators.
